/// Remembers the plans a host prepared so repeated execution of an already-prepared plan can be

/// re-canonical-hashing, and re-sealing the whole module on every dispatch (ALG-0013).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A plan is keyed by its seal, which is an HMAC over the validated module/policy/binding identity
/// using the host signing key. Only plans this host produced via <c>PrepareAsync</c> are registered,
/// so a cache hit proves the seal is authentic; the cached entry is then the trusted reference the
/// incoming plan's fields are compared against (see <see cref="ExecutionPlanGuard"/>). A miss
/// (tampered seal, or a plan from another host) falls back to the full rebuild-and-compare path,
/// preserving every existing rejection.
