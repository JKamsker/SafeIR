# CMP-0016: Filter and formula contracts have no package-backed authoring surface

## Claim

The addendum presents simple filters and formulas as shared plugin contracts, but the current user-facing SafeIR package authoring path only lowers `IEventKernel<TEvent>` kernels. The runnable simple filter/formula example instantiates the C# implementations directly and calls them as normal host objects, so it does not prove that `IItemFilter` or `IDamageFormula` can be uploaded, validated, lowered to Safe IR, installed, or executed through the plugin package boundary.

## Why this matters

A plugin author can reasonably read the addendum walkthrough as a supported progression from simple filters/formulas to kernels. Today only the kernel path has a package-backed SafeIR surface. That leaves a feature-completeness gap: the docs and examples include non-event contracts, but users cannot build or ship those contracts through the same SafeIR upload/install path without inventing their own lowering/adapter model.

## Evidence

- `docs/Specs/Addendum/Addendum.md:82` documents `IItemFilter`, and `docs/Specs/Addendum/Addendum.md:87` documents `IDamageFormula` as shared plugin-slot interfaces.
- `docs/Specs/Addendum/Addendum.md:148` states that the current SDK generator lowers `IEventKernel<TEvent>` kernels and that other shared interfaces are only contract guidance until a host provides a matching adapter/lowering path.
- `docs/Specs/Addendum/Examples.md:17` starts the public walkthrough with "Implement A Simple Filter", while `docs/Specs/Addendum/Examples.md:47` again says the current generator only lowers `IEventKernel<TEvent>` kernels into plugin packages.
- `examples/Addendum/README.md:12` lists "simple filters and formulas" as runnable addendum examples in `SimpleContractExamples.cs`.
- `examples/Addendum/SafeIR.AddendumExamples/Examples/SimpleContractExamples.cs:21` creates `new EpicItemsOnly()` and `new ArmorAdjustedDamageFormula()` directly, then calls `Accept`/`Calculate` as ordinary C# methods. It does not export a package, import JSON, install into `PluginServer`, or execute via `SandboxHost`.
- `examples/PluginIpc/SafeIR.PluginIpc.Server.Abstractions/ItemContracts.cs:3` and `examples/PluginIpc/SafeIR.PluginIpc.Server.Abstractions/FormulaContracts.cs:3` define the contracts, but the exposed package/generator path in this repo is event-kernel based.

This is distinct from the existing event-kernel findings: `CMP-0006` covers implicit event adapter discovery, `CMP-0007` covers production JSON upload coverage, and `CMP-0010` covers manifest inspection details. This finding is specifically about the non-event filter/formula contract category having no package-backed user-facing surface.

## Suggested test or benchmark

Add a package-backed completeness smoke test for one non-event contract, for example an `IItemFilter` package that is generated or adapted into Safe IR, exported to JSON, installed through the public server/upload boundary, and invoked through a public filter/formula execution API. If non-event contracts are intentionally out of scope for the release, add a docs-smoke assertion that the simple filter/formula walkthrough is clearly labeled host-side guidance and is not presented as a runnable SafeIR plugin package feature.

## Suggested fix direction

Either provide a small explicit lowering/adapter surface for simple filters and formulas, with a runnable example that proves upload/install/execute through SafeIR, or split those sections out of the package-backed walkthrough and label them as host-side contract design guidance only. Do not execute arbitrary plugin DLLs or bypass the existing JSON Safe IR package boundary to make the examples pass.

## Scope boundaries

Do not change the event-kernel package flow, plugin-server policy, or IPC sample as part of this finding unless needed to wire a narrowly scoped non-event contract example. Keep any new surface explicit and capability-checked rather than treating arbitrary shared interfaces as executable plugin code by default.

## Deduplication key

`completeness/addendum/simple-filter-formula/no-package-backed-lowering-surface`

## Verification checklist

- [ ] A non-event contract example is either package-backed and runnable through SafeIR, or clearly documented as host-side-only guidance.
- [ ] The public walkthrough no longer implies simple filters/formulas are complete uploadable plugin package features unless they are.
- [ ] The smoke/docs gate catches future drift between documented contract categories and package-backed example coverage.
- [ ] Existing event-kernel plugin behavior remains unchanged.
