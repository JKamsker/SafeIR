# ALG-0003: Generated meter analysis repeatedly rescans predecessors

## Claim

Generated method metering analysis repeatedly scans the full instruction list to rediscover predecessor and instruction-index information, so verification cost can grow quadratically with method size/control-flow density.

## Evidence

- `src/SafeIR.Verifier/Generated/Methods/GeneratedMethodMeterAnalyzer.cs:64` materializes `Predecessors(analysis, instruction.Offset).ToArray()` for an immediate-meter check.
- `src/SafeIR.Verifier/Generated/Methods/GeneratedMethodMeterAnalyzer.cs:126` scans `analysis.Instructions` from the beginning to find the current instruction index every time `HasPositiveImmediateMeterAmount(analysis, instruction)` is called.
- `src/SafeIR.Verifier/Generated/Methods/GeneratedMethodMeterAnalyzer.cs:136` implements `Predecessors` as `analysis.Instructions.Where(...)`, and each candidate asks `GeneratedMethodFlowAnalyzer.Successors(...).Contains(offset)`.
- `src/SafeIR.Verifier/Generated/Methods/GeneratedMethodMeterAnalyzer.cs:21` and `src/SafeIR.Verifier/Generated/Methods/GeneratedMethodMeterAnalyzer.cs:83` call successor traversal inside queue-based graph walks, so the immediate-meter helper can be reached for many instructions during both unmetered-work and sparse-meter checks.
- Existing benchmarks are under `benchmarks/SafeIR.Benchmarks/Ipc`; there is no verifier benchmark that scales generated method size, branch count, or meter density.

## Impact

A generated method with many branches or meter calls pays repeated O(instruction-count) scans while already walking the control-flow graph. This can make artifact verification latency grow faster than the IL size for large generated kernels, exactly on the prepare/cache path where compilation and verification are expected to be predictable.

## Better target

Precompute instruction index by offset and predecessor lists once as part of `GeneratedMethodFlow`, or during analyzer setup. Immediate-meter checks should be O(1) for index lookup and O(in-degree) for predecessor inspection instead of O(instructions * successors) per check.

## Benchmark idea

Add a BenchmarkDotNet verifier benchmark that constructs generated methods with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 instructions plus configurable branch fan-out and meter frequency. Measure elapsed time and allocations for `GeneratedAssemblyVerifier` or the generated method flow/meter analyzers before and after predecessor/index caching.
