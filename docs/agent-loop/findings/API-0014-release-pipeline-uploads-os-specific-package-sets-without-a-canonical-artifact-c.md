# API-0014: Release pipeline uploads OS-specific package sets without a canonical artifact check

# Release pipeline uploads OS-specific package sets without a canonical artifact check

## Problem

The CI package job runs in a Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS matrix, and each matrix leg runs `dotnet pack` for the same public SafeIR package IDs and versions. The workflow then uploads `artifacts/packages/*.nupkg` separately as `packages-${{ matrix.os }}`. The metadata gate checks each leg's packages independently, but no release gate chooses one canonical package set or proves that the three OS-built package sets are byte-for-byte identical.

## Why this matters

SafeIR's public NuGet packages should have one reproducible artifact set for a given package ID, version, and repository commit. If cross-OS packing produces different nupkg bytes, nuspec metadata, embedded paths, generated files, timestamps, or analyzer/package layout, the current release pipeline can still pass and leave maintainers with multiple valid-looking artifacts for the same version. A later publish step could upload whichever artifact set was downloaded first, making package provenance ambiguous and making release reproduction harder.

## Evidence

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines `build-test-pack` with `matrix.os: [ windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macos-latest ]`.
- The `Pack` step runs inside that matrix and writes `dotnet pack SafeIR.slnx --configuration Release --no-build --output artifacts/packages` on every OS.
- The `Upload package artifacts` step uploads the same package glob as `packages-${{ matrix.os }}`, producing three artifact sets for the same package IDs and versions.
- `scripts/check-package-metadata.ps1` validates fields, expected package IDs, repository commit, package layout, and prerelease policy for the packages in one directory, but it does not compare package hashes across matrix legs or designate a canonical publish source.

## Suggested fix

Split package publishing from cross-platform build/test validation. Either pack once in a canonical release job after all OS tests pass, or add a release gate that downloads the Windows/Linux/macOS package artifacts, normalizes only explicitly allowed non-deterministic metadata if needed, and fails unless each package ID/version has identical package bytes and nuspec/package entries across OSes. Publish only the canonical or verified-identical package set.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] CI/release has exactly one canonical package artifact set for each package ID/version, or a gate proves all matrix-built package sets are identical before upload/publish.
- [ ] The package metadata/release validation path fails if two OS legs produce different `.nupkg` contents for the same package ID/version.
- [ ] Release documentation states which package artifact set is publishable.
