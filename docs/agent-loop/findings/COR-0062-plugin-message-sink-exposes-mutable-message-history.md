# COR-0062: Plugin message sink exposes mutable message history

## Evidence

`InMemoryPluginMessageSink.Messages` is typed as `IReadOnlyList<PluginMessage>` but returns the private mutable `List<PluginMessage>` instance directly (`src/SafeIR.Plugins/Contracts.cs`). Any consumer can cast the property value back to `List<PluginMessage>` and add, remove, or clear messages outside the sink APIs.

## Impact

Code that relies on the sink as a read-only record of plugin messages can observe forged or deleted messages. This affects host-side diagnostics, tests, and any validation/audit code that treats the exposed `IReadOnlyList` as immutable history.

## Fix direction

Return an immutable snapshot or read-only wrapper that does not expose the backing list, and add an immutability regression test that verifies callers cannot mutate the stored message history through `Messages`.
