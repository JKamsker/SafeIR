# COR-0059: Collection equality validates but compares backing collection identity

## Evidence

`FunctionAnalyzer.AnalyzeBinary` accepts `==` and `!=` whenever the left and right operands have the same `SandboxType`, including `List<T>` and `Map<K,V>` values (`src/SafeIR.Validation/FunctionAnalyzer.cs`). The interpreter and compiled runtime then evaluate equality with `Equals(left, right)` (`src/SafeIR.Interpreter/ExpressionEvaluator.cs`, `src/SafeIR.Runtime/CompiledRuntime.cs`).

Collection sandbox values are records whose `Values` fields are `IReadOnlyList<SandboxValue>` or `IReadOnlyDictionary<SandboxValue, SandboxValue>` (`src/SafeIR.Core/Sandbox/SandboxValue.cs`). Those backing collection interfaces use reference equality, so two independently materialized collections with the same elements do not compare structurally.

A validated expression such as `list.of(1) == list.of(1)` therefore type-checks but can evaluate to `false` because each `list.of` call constructs a distinct backing list (`src/SafeIR.Interpreter/Internal/CollectionOperations.cs`). Maps have the same issue for independently constructed equal maps.

## Impact

Safe-IR exposes equality on collection-typed expressions but returns identity-based answers that disagree with value semantics. Branches, policies, and binding decisions can take the wrong path when equivalent collection values are reconstructed instead of reusing the same backing instance.

## Fix direction

Either implement deterministic structural equality for sandbox list and map values in the shared runtime equality path, or reject collection equality in validation and document equality as scalar-only. Add interpreter and compiled-runtime regression tests for equal and unequal lists/maps constructed from separate expressions.
