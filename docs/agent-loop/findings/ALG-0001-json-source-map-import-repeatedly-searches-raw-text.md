# ALG-0001: JSON source map import repeatedly searches raw text

## Claim

`SafeIrJsonImporter.Import` builds source spans with repeated raw-text extraction and string searches, making import cost grow poorly for large JSON IR documents.

## Evidence

- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/SafeIrJsonImporter.cs:12` first scans the full JSON with `JsonImportBudgetGuard.Validate`, then `JsonDocument.Parse` parses it again at `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/SafeIrJsonImporter.cs:13`.
- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/SafeIrJsonImporter.cs:20` always constructs a `JsonSourceMap` for the whole document before reading the module.
- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/Internal/JsonSourceMap.cs:38` calls `JsonElement.GetRawText()` for every visited element, allocating a raw JSON string per node.
- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/Internal/JsonSourceMap.cs:39` searches the full JSON with `IndexOf(rawText, cursor, Ordinal)` per element, falling back to another full search at `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/Internal/JsonSourceMap.cs:42`.
- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/Internal/JsonSourceMap.cs:81` computes line/column by scanning from the beginning of `_json` to the found index for each span.
- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/Internal/JsonSourceMap.cs:24` repeats `GetRawText()` for every `SpanFor` lookup while importing statements and expressions.

## Impact

Current behavior is at least repeated full-document scanning and can approach quadratic work as node count and byte offsets grow. The realistic trigger is generated IR with thousands of statements/expressions near the 100,000-token import budget, where import/prepare latency matters and diagnostics still require source spans.

## Better target

Track byte offsets/line starts during a single UTF-8 reader pass, or maintain a line-start index and map parser token positions to spans without per-node `GetRawText()` plus `IndexOf`. Target should be roughly O(bytes + nodes), with bounded per-node allocation.

## Benchmark idea

Add a BenchmarkDotNet import benchmark that generates modules with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 simple statements/expressions and measures `SafeIrJsonImporter.Import` time plus allocated bytes. Include a duplicate-looking literal-heavy case to expose `_spansByRawText` queue behavior.
