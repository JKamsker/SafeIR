# API-0021: Module JSON exporter is omitted from public package guidance and smoke coverage

## Claim

`SafeIrJsonExporter` is shipped as a public module serialization API, but the public package guidance and package consumer smoke only prove JSON import and plugin package upload. A user can discover `SafeIrJsonImporter` and `PluginPackageJsonSerializer` from README/package smoke, while the module export surface is only present in the public API spec and source.

## Why this matters

Programmatic tooling that builds or transforms `SandboxModule` instances needs a supported way to serialize them back to JSON IR. If the exporter namespace, package placement, or transitive dependencies drift, the current release gates can still pass because no package-backed consumer compiles or calls the exporter. Users also have no README-level install/namespace guidance for the round-trip path.

## Evidence

- `src/SafeIR.Serialization.Json/SafeIrJsonExporter.cs:6` declares public `SafeIrJsonExporter`.
- `docs/Specs/Initial/safe-ir-sandbox-spec/spec/16-public-api.md:432` lists `SafeIrJsonExporter` in the JSON serialization public API.
- `README.md:14` describes `SafeIR.Serialization.Json` as JSON IR importer, host import extensions, and plugin package JSON upload helpers, but does not mention module export.
- `README.md:51` says `SafeIR.Serialization.Json` is for `ImportJsonAsync` and `SafeIrJsonImporter`, again omitting `SafeIrJsonExporter`.
- `scripts/check-package-consumer-smoke.ps1:144` through `scripts/check-package-consumer-smoke.ps1:147` compile-check `SafeIrJsonImporter`, `PluginPackageJsonSerializer`, and IPC types, but do not reference or call `SafeIrJsonExporter.Export(...)`.

## Suggested test or smoke

Extend the package consumer smoke or add a docs-smoke fixture that constructs a small `SandboxModule`, calls `SafeIrJsonExporter.Export(module)`, imports the exported JSON with `SafeIrJsonImporter` or `ImportJsonAsync`, and validates that the round-tripped module can be prepared. The fixture should use the public package references and namespaces documented for consumers.

## Suggested fix direction

Update README package guidance and common namespaces to name `SafeIrJsonExporter` as part of `SafeIR.Serialization.Json`. Add a short round-trip snippet near the JSON IR example or public API docs, then wire that snippet into release smoke so exporter package placement remains covered.

## Scope boundaries

This does not change export behavior or allocation characteristics; `PAL-0012` already tracks exporter allocation performance. This also does not replace the versioned JSON schema work tracked separately.
