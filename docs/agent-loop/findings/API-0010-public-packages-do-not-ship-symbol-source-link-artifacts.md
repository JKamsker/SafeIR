# API-0010: Public packages do not ship symbol/source-link artifacts

## Claim
Public SafeIR packages are not configured or gated to produce NuGet symbol packages with source-link/debugging metadata, so package consumers cannot reliably step from a shipped package back to the exact source used for the release.

## Evidence
- `Directory.Build.props` sets shared package metadata and `ContinuousIntegrationBuild`, but it does not set `IncludeSymbols`, `SymbolPackageFormat`, `PublishRepositoryUrl`, or `EmbedUntrackedSources` for the public package projects.
- The source project files under `src/` only set target frameworks, references, and analyzer-specific packing; none override symbol/source-link package settings.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` packs to `artifacts/packages` and uploads only `artifacts/packages/*.nupkg`; it has no `.snupkg` artifact check or upload path.
- `scripts/check-package-metadata.ps1` validates nuspec metadata, expected package IDs, repository commit, dependencies, and package entries, but it does not require a matching symbol package or source-link metadata for each shipped library package.

## Impact
This is a public package readiness gap. When a consumer hits a SafeIR runtime, verifier, compiler, transport, or analyzer issue from NuGet, the release artifacts do not prove that debuggable symbols/source mapping were produced and retained for the package version. That makes incident diagnosis and API support materially harder after release.

## Better target
Configure public package projects to emit portable symbols and `.snupkg` packages with repository/source-link metadata, upload those artifacts in CI, and extend release/package validation so every shipped library package has a matching symbol package for the same ID/version.

## Acceptance test idea
After `dotnet pack SafeIR.slnx --configuration Release --no-build --output artifacts/packages`, a gate should fail unless every public non-analyzer package has both `.nupkg` and `.snupkg` artifacts for the same package ID/version and the symbols carry repository/source-link metadata for the current commit.
