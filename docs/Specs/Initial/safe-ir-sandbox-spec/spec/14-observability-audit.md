# 14 — Observability and Audit

## Purpose

The sandbox should be observable for debugging, performance tuning, abuse detection, and security review.

## Run identity

Every execution gets a run ID.

```text
runId = globally unique ID
moduleHash = canonical IR hash
planHash = execution plan hash
policyHash = policy hash
```

## Required audit fields

```text
runId
tenantId optional
userId/scriptAuthor optional
moduleId/moduleHash
policyId/policyHash
bindingManifestHash
executionMode
cacheStatus
timestamp
success/failure
errorCode optional
fuelUsed
maxFuel
allocationCharged
hostCalls
artifactHash optional
```

The current `RunSummary` event stores these as structured string fields where possible. Duration,
completed-at timestamps, and capability-grant/use rollups are recommended operational extensions,
not required fields in the current public `SandboxAuditEvent` shape.
Hosts can attach an operational audit observer with `SandboxHostBuilder.ForwardAuditEventsTo(...)`.
The observer receives the same sequenced events returned in `SandboxExecutionResult.AuditEvents`,
so callers can forward them to retention, metrics, tracing, and alerting pipelines without
changing execution behavior.

## Binding audit events

For each audited binding call:

```text
runId
sequenceNumber
bindingId
capabilityId
effect
resourceKind
resourceId sanitized
startedAt
duration optional
success/failure
bytesRead/bytesWritten optional
errorCode optional
```

Runtime enforcement:

- `AuditLevel.None` bindings do not require binding audit events.
- Any other `AuditLevel` requires a non-debug audit event with the binding ID.
- A successful binding call must emit a successful audit event before the call is accepted.
- A failed binding call must leave a failed audit event. If the binding fails before it can emit
  one, the runtime writes a sanitized `BindingCall` failure event and preserves the original
  sandbox error.
- Interpreted debug traces are diagnostics only and never satisfy binding audit requirements.

## Sanitization

Audit logs should be useful but not leak secrets.

Avoid logging:

- raw file contents
- auth headers
- access tokens
- connection strings
- full host filesystem paths if sensitive
- raw exception messages containing secrets
- personal data unless necessary and allowed

Use sanitized resource IDs:

```text
file-grant:tenant-123-config/settings.json
https://api.example.com/path without query secrets
player:5751
item:quest_reward_001
```

## Metrics

Recommended metrics:

```text
sandbox.runs.total
sandbox.runs.failed
sandbox.runs.duration
sandbox.fuel.used
sandbox.quota.exceeded
sandbox.policy.denied
sandbox.cache.hit
sandbox.cache.miss
sandbox.cache.invalid
sandbox.compile.duration
sandbox.verify.duration
sandbox.interpreter.duration
sandbox.binding.calls
sandbox.binding.duration
sandbox.worker.killed
```

Labels:

```text
executionMode
bindingId
errorCode
policyId
tenant/trust-zone if safe
```

Avoid high-cardinality labels like raw module hash unless metrics system can handle it.

## Tracing

Trace spans:

```text
Sandbox.Prepare
Sandbox.ImportJson
Sandbox.Validate
Sandbox.ResolvePolicy
Sandbox.Interpret
Sandbox.Compile
Sandbox.Verify
Sandbox.LoadAssembly
Sandbox.Execute
Sandbox.BindingCall
```

Compiled run summaries include both compiler cache status and host
materialization status so operators can distinguish DLL cache reuse from
loaded delegate reuse.

## Debug traces

For interpreted mode, optional debug traces:

```text
instruction executed
JSON location or IR node ID
local values summarized
fuel remaining
binding call
```

Current `DebugTrace` audit events include structured fields for:

```text
moduleHash
functionId
category
nodeKind
sourceLine
sourceColumn
fuelRemaining
```

Debug trace timestamps use the same audit timestamp policy as other sandbox events. Under a
deterministic policy they must use the policy logical clock, or the Unix epoch when the policy has
no logical clock.

These should be disabled in production by default or heavily limited.

## Security alerts

Alert on:

- verifier failure
- generated assembly rejected
- cache hash mismatch
- repeated policy-denied attempts
- repeated quota exhaustion
- unexpected binding exception
- worker process killed
- forbidden path/network attempts
- compiled/interpreted differential test failure in CI

## Audit retention

Retention depends on product needs, but security-relevant events should outlive cache entries.

Suggested minimum:

- execution summary: 30-90 days
- policy denials: 90 days
- verifier/cache integrity failures: 180+ days
- high-risk binding calls: business/security policy dependent

## User-facing diagnostics

Keep user-facing errors clear but safe.

Good:

```text
file.readText denied: path is outside the granted sandbox root.
```

Bad:

```text
UnauthorizedAccessException at C:\prod\secrets\tenant-123\db-password.txt stack trace...
```

## Developer diagnostics

Trusted admins can access richer diagnostics:

- internal exception IDs
- stack traces
- verifier diagnostics
- cache paths
- binding config

Still avoid secrets by default.

## Abuse detection

Track per user/module:

- quota exhaustion rate
- policy-denied operation attempts
- repeated path traversal attempts
- repeated network blocked hosts
- high compile/cache churn
- large log output
- high memory budget usage

Use this to throttle or require review.
