# 08 — Runtime Safe APIs

## Purpose

Runtime safe APIs are the only way sandboxed code reaches host resources.

They are narrow, capability-aware, budget-aware, and auditable.

## `SandboxContext`

`SandboxContext` is the execution root passed to interpreter and compiled code.

It should provide:

```csharp
public sealed class SandboxContext
{
    public SandboxRunId RunId { get; }
    public SandboxPolicy Policy { get; }
    public ResourceMeter Budget { get; }
    public BindingRegistry Bindings { get; }
    public IAuditSink Audit { get; }
    public CancellationToken CancellationToken { get; }

    public void RequireCapability(string capabilityId);
    public CapabilityGrant GetCapability(string capabilityId);
    public void ChargeFuel(int amount);
    public void ChargeAllocation(long bytes);
}
```

Do not expose service providers, host containers, or arbitrary host state from `SandboxContext`.

## Safe file API

### Goals

- scoped paths only
- no absolute paths from user
- no path traversal
- no direct `System.IO.File` access from IR/generated code
- enforce size quotas
- audit file access

### Sandbox path

Use a `SandboxPath` value, not raw OS paths.

```text
SandboxPath = canonical relative path inside a named root
```

Examples:

```text
config/settings.json
assets/icon.png
```

Reject:

```text
../secret.txt
./config/settings.json
config/../secret.txt
config/./settings.json
C:\Windows\win.ini
/etc/passwd
\\server\share\file
file://...
NUL
CON.txt
paths containing control characters
segments ending with dot or space
```

Path literals must already be canonical. The importer and runtime reject `.` and
`..` segments instead of normalizing them.

### Safe facade

```csharp
public sealed class SafeFileSystem
{
    public ValueTask<string> ReadTextAsync(
        SandboxContext ctx,
        SandboxPath path,
        CancellationToken ct);

    public ValueTask WriteTextAsync(
        SandboxContext ctx,
        SandboxPath path,
        string text,
        CancellationToken ct);
}
```

### Required checks

For read:

1. require `file.read`
2. resolve named root from capability grant
3. reject absolute paths
4. normalize separators
5. combine root + relative path
6. canonicalize full path
7. ensure final path remains inside root
8. reject disallowed extension
9. check file size before read if possible
10. enforce max bytes per file/run
11. charge fuel/allocation
12. audit sanitized path

The current policy surface supports `allowedExtensions` on file grants. General path glob matching
is a host extension point and is not part of the built-in grant validator.

For write:

1. require `file.write`
2. same path checks
3. enforce create/overwrite policy
4. write atomically when possible
5. enforce max bytes
6. audit

### Symlink/reparse-point warning

Path prefix checks alone can be insufficient in the presence of symlinks, junctions, or reparse points.

Defense options:

- reject symlinks/reparse points in sandbox roots
- resolve final real path when possible
- open handles safely and validate after open
- use OS-level filesystem permissions for the worker account
- use container/chroot-like isolation for high-risk tenants

## Safe network API

Network should be disabled by default.

Facade:

```csharp
public sealed class SafeHttpClient
{
    public ValueTask<SandboxHttpResponse> GetAsync(
        SandboxContext ctx,
        SandboxUri uri,
        CancellationToken ct);
}
```

Required checks:

- require `net.http.get` or similar
- allow only configured schemes, usually `https`
- allow only configured hosts
- reject IP literals unless explicitly allowed
- reject localhost/private ranges unless explicitly allowed
- enforce DNS pinning/rebinding protections for every real network request
- enforce request/response size limits
- enforce the stricter of the request timeout and remaining sandbox wall-time budget
- audit host/path sanitized

The production transport must own the real network path. Host code may provide an explicit
in-memory HTTP invoker for tests and deterministic fixtures, but arbitrary `HttpClient`,
`HttpMessageHandler`, socket, stream, or handler injection is not part of the sandbox API.
Opaque custom transports cannot prove that they connected to the vetted DNS/IP target and
must not be treated as pinned network execution.

Do not expose raw `HttpClient`, sockets, streams, handlers, or headers that can smuggle credentials unless explicitly modeled.

## Safe game-state API

Do not expose live mutable game objects.

Use snapshots and commands.

Read example:

```csharp
public sealed record PlayerSnapshot(
    PlayerId Id,
    string Name,
    int Level,
    int Health,
    IReadOnlyList<ItemSnapshot> Inventory);
```

Mutation example:

```csharp
public sealed record InventoryCommand(
    PlayerId PlayerId,
    ItemId ItemId,
    int Amount,
    string Reason);
```

Sandbox execution produces commands:

```text
commands = ExecuteQuestLogic(snapshot)
host validates commands in transaction
host applies commands
```

This avoids direct mutation during sandbox execution.

## Safe database API

Prefer not exposing database APIs.

Instead expose domain-specific query bindings:

```text
game.quest.getProgress(playerId, questId)
game.item.getDefinition(itemId)
```

Avoid:

- raw SQL
- LINQ/IQueryable
- DbContext
- connection objects
- transaction objects

If database-like queries are needed, define a small JSON query IR with row/byte/time limits.

## Safe clock API

Clock is an effect.

```csharp
public interface ISandboxClock
{
    DateTimeOffset UtcNow(SandboxContext ctx);
}
```

In deterministic mode, clock returns policy-provided logical time or is unavailable.

## Safe random API

Randomness is an effect.

```csharp
public interface ISandboxRandom
{
    int NextInt32(SandboxContext ctx, int minInclusive, int maxExclusive);
}
```

Policy decides:

- deterministic seeded random
- nondeterministic random
- forbidden random

For game/economy/security behavior, prefer host-owned randomness outside the sandbox.

## Safe collections

Sandbox collections enforce allocation budgets.

```csharp
public sealed class SandboxList<T>
{
    public int Count { get; }
    public T Get(int index);
    public SandboxList<T> Add(SandboxContext ctx, T value);
}

public sealed class SandboxMap<TKey, TValue>
{
    public bool ContainsKey(TKey key);
    public TValue Get(TKey key);
    public SandboxMap<TKey, TValue> Set(SandboxContext ctx, TKey key, TValue value);
    public SandboxMap<TKey, TValue> Remove(SandboxContext ctx, TKey key);
}
```

Growth and copy-on-write updates charge allocation budget. Missing map keys return a safe
`NotFound` sandbox error. Unsupported map key types are rejected during validation. List
length, map entry count, nested collection depth, and total collection elements are checked
against policy resource limits.

## Safe logging API

Sandbox-visible logging should be structured and quota-limited.

```text
log.info(message)
log.warn(message)
```

Both operations require the host-granted `log.write` capability and emit sanitized
`SandboxLog` audit events.

Limits:

- max log events per run
- max message length
- no secrets
- audit correlation by run ID

## Safe error API

Use sandbox error values:

```text
PermissionDenied
InvalidInput
NotFound
QuotaExceeded
Timeout
Cancelled
HostFailure
```

Do not leak raw host exceptions to untrusted code.

## Facade implementation principles

Every safe API must:

- require capability when effectful
- charge fuel/alloc/IO budgets
- accept cancellation
- enforce timeouts for external operations
- sanitize errors
- emit audit events when needed
- avoid returning raw host objects
- be deterministic when marked deterministic

## Anti-patterns

Do not expose:

```csharp
IServiceProvider
Func<string, object>
object Invoke(string name, object[] args)
Type GetType(string name)
Assembly Load(string name)
Stream Open(string path)
HttpClient Client
DbContext Db
Player LivePlayer
```

The sandbox should expose verbs, not power tools.
