# Followups: `[KernelMethod]` inlining and kernel RPC services

Two follow-on features layered on the lowering pipeline and the kernel runtime. Both keep the SafeIR
invariant: plugin authors write plain C#, the generator lowers it to **verified, sandboxed IR**, and the
server never compiles plugin source.

---

## 1. `[KernelMethod]` — call reusable kernel methods from hooks

### Goal

Let a plugin author factor shared gate/handler logic out of a `Where`/`Select`/`InvokeKernel` lambda (or
a kernel-class `ShouldHandle`/`Handle`) into a named static helper, without leaving the sandbox:

```csharp
server.Hooks.On<MonsterAggroEvent>()
    .Where((e, ctx) => IsBullyingLowLevelPlayer(e.MonsterLevel, e.PlayerLevel, e.Distance, 3, 5, 5))
    .InvokeKernel((e, ctx) => ctx.Messages.Send(e.MonsterId, "calm"));

[KernelMethod]
public static bool IsBullyingLowLevelPlayer(
    int monsterLevel, int playerLevel, int distance, int levelGap, int aggroRange, int protectMaxLevel)
    => monsterLevel - playerLevel >= levelGap && distance <= aggroRange && playerLevel <= protectMaxLevel;
```

### How it works (inlining, not calling)

There is **no call** in the lowered IR — the method body is **inlined** at each call site. The generator:

1. Resolves the invoked symbol and checks for `[KernelMethod]`
   ([SafeIrKernelMethodInliner](../../../src/SafeIR.PluginAnalyzer/Analysis/Lowering/Expressions/SafeIrKernelMethodInliner.cs)).
   A method without the attribute returns `null` so the normal dispatch continues; once the attribute is
   seen the inliner *owns* the call and any unsupported shape throws `NotSupportedException` (fail-safe).
2. Lowers each call-site argument in the **calling** context (so a `[HostBinding]` call or
   `[Capability]`-gated read passed as an argument still contributes its capability to the kernel's
   manifest).
3. Lowers the method's body with each parameter name bound to its already-lowered argument IR — the same
   compile-time substitution the `Select` projection uses (`ProjectedElement`), generalized to N
   parameters via `SafeIrExpressionLoweringContext.InlinedBindings` and resolved first in
   `LowerIdentifier` (so a parameter correctly shadows a same-named live setting).
4. Switches to the method body's own semantic model (the body may live in another file/tree).

The result is identical to writing the body inline, so it composes with everything the lambda lowering
already supports (AND-composed `Where`s, `Select` projection, the terminal `Send`).

### Where it plugs in

`SafeIrInvocationExpressionLowerer.Lower` tries, in order: `[HostBinding]` → `[KernelMethod]` →
`string.Equals`/`Substring` → throw. So the inliner sits next to the existing host-binding lowerer and
benefits from the same `catch (NotSupportedException)` fail-safe in `HookChainModelFactory` /
`PluginKernelModelFactory` (no package emitted; the runtime terminal throws `SGP062`).

### Constraints (verified at generation time; violation fails safe)

- The method must be **`static`**.
- Its body must be an **expression body** or a **single `return` statement** (no locals/loops — those are
  what the kernel-RPC statement lowerer in §2 adds for the batch-entrypoint shape).
- Parameters and return must be **supported scalars** (`bool`, `int`, `long`, `double`, `string`) — the
  same scalar set the rest of the lowering pipeline uses. A host-service interface cannot be passed as a
  parameter; call the `[HostBinding]` directly and pass its scalar result.
- **No recursion** — a `[KernelMethod]` inlining itself (directly or transitively) is rejected via an
  inline-stack guard.

### Incrementality note

Like the existing `[HostBinding]` lowering, the inliner reaches across syntax trees through the semantic
model. A full `dotnet build` always regenerates correctly; in rare IDE incremental-refresh cases editing
only a `[KernelMethod]` body in a *different* file than the call site may not re-lower until the next
build. This matches the host-binding precedent.

### Example

`GuardianKernel.ShouldHandle` ([example](../../../examples/GameServer/SafeIR.Game.Plugin/Kernels/GuardianKernel.cs))
factors its "is this monster bullying a weaker player in range?" rule into
`IsBullyingLowLevelPlayer([KernelMethod])`, passing the live settings as arguments. The example runs
end-to-end unchanged (exit 0; damage/tick drops from baseline exactly as before).

### Tests

[`PluginAnalyzerKernelMethodTests`](../../../tests/SafeIR.Tests/PluginAnalyzer/Generated/PluginAnalyzerKernelMethodTests.cs):
inlining into a kernel-class `ShouldHandle` (runtime gate equivalence), into an inline `Where` chain,
multi-argument helpers, capability collection through a `[HostBinding]` argument (manifest + install
under a wildcard grant), and the multi-statement-body fail-safe (no chain package generated).

---

## 2. Kernel RPC services

### Goal

Let a plugin ship a **batch operation** that runs server-side in a single roundtrip, so a loop over many
entities executes on the server (calling the host's existing bindings) instead of one network call per
entity — and so it can take and return **complex objects and lists of objects**. The motivating shape:

```csharp
await server.RegisterKernelRpcService<IMonsterKillerService, MonsterKillerKernel>();
List<KillResult> killed = server.KernelRpcService<IMonsterKillerService>().KillMonsters(ids); // one roundtrip

public interface IMonsterKillerService { List<KillResult> KillMonsters(List<int> monsterIds); }
public readonly record struct KillResult(int MonsterId, bool Success);

[KernelRpcService("monster-killer")]
public sealed partial class MonsterKillerKernel
{
    public List<KillResult> KillMonsters(List<int> monsterIds, HookContext ctx)
    {
        var results = new List<KillResult>();
        foreach (var id in monsterIds)
            results.Add(new KillResult(id, ctx.Host<IGameWorld>().Kill(id)));
        return results;
    }
}
```

### Why it is a sandboxed kernel (not trusted RPC)

In the target deployment the **server is frozen at release**; only plugins change. So the batch logic
must be shipped by the plugin and run on the server — and to be safe that means **verified, sandboxed
IR** (the same trust model as event kernels), calling only the host bindings the server already exposes.
A bespoke trusted RPC endpoint per plugin is impossible (the server cannot be recompiled).

### The record type — complex objects in the sandbox

Complex objects required a new composite **`Record`** type in the IR (§ "IR record/object type" commit):
`SandboxType.Record([fieldTypes])` + `RecordValue` + the `record.new`/`record.get` intrinsics, threaded
through the interpreter, validator, value validation, shape metering, canonical hashing, and JSON. A
record is a **positional** tuple; field *names* live in the analyzer and the host marshaling layer, which
map a C# DTO's members to record fields by **declaration order**. `List<Record>` is a list of objects.

Records run in the **interpreter** (the full sandbox semantics: validation, capabilities, resource
limits). Compiled-mode record emission is deferred — the verifier permits `newarr` only for
`SandboxValue`, so variable-arity record *types* can't yet be emitted as IL — so RPC kernels always
install interpreted (`PluginServer.InstallRpcAsync`).

### The pieces

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Authoring** ([`[KernelRpcService]`](../../../src/SafeIR.Server.Abstractions/Contracts.cs)) | Marks the class; its one public batch method (trailing `HookContext` = host-binding marker) is the entrypoint. |
| **Lowering** ([`RpcKernelModelFactory`](../../../src/SafeIR.PluginAnalyzer/Analysis/Rpc/RpcKernelModelFactory.cs), [`SafeIrRpcJsonLowerer`](../../../src/SafeIR.PluginAnalyzer/Analysis/Rpc/SafeIrRpcJsonLowerer.cs)) | Lowers the method body to verified IR **JSON** and emits a `<Name>PluginPackage` whose `Create()` imports it — so it ships exactly like an event kernel. Supports locals, a `foreach` over a list, `if`/`else`, host bindings, DTO construction (`new T(...)`/`new T{...}` → `record.new`), list accumulation (`list.Add` → `list.add`), indexing/`.Count`, and `return`. |
| **Package + install** ([`PluginManifest.RpcEntrypoint`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/PluginManifest.cs), [`RpcKernelPackageValidator`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/Runtime/Rpc/RpcKernelPackageValidator.cs)) | A distinct package shape (no event subscription/contract) validated and installed via `InstallRpcAsync` / `PluginSession.InstallRpcAsync` (owned + revoked on disconnect, like event kernels). |
| **Invoke** ([`InstalledKernel.InvokeRpcAsync`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/Kernel/InstalledKernel.Rpc.cs)) | Binds caller args to the entrypoint's leading parameters (live settings fill the trailing ones), runs the IR once under the execution gate, and **returns** the result value (not discarded). |
| **Typed surface** ([`KernelRpcMarshaller`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/Runtime/Rpc/KernelRpcMarshaller.cs), [`KernelRpcServiceProxy`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/Runtime/Rpc/KernelRpcServiceProxy.cs), [`PluginServer.RpcService`](../../../src/SafeIR.Plugins/Runtime/Rpc/PluginServer.Rpc.cs)) | `RegisterRpcServiceAsync<TService, TKernel>()` installs the kernel and binds the contract; `RpcService<TService>()` returns a runtime proxy that marshals C# args ↔ sandbox values (scalars, lists, DTOs, lists of DTOs) so `service.KillMonsters(ids)` returns real `List<KillResult>`. |

### Capabilities and effects

Host bindings called in the body contribute their capability and effects to the manifest exactly as in
event kernels (deny-at-install if the policy lacks them); the manifest declares `Cpu` + `Alloc` (when it
builds lists/records) + the binding effects, matched against the verified entrypoint.

### Constraints / current scope

- **Interpreted only** (compiled-mode record emission deferred, as above).
- One batch method per service; parameters/return/DTO fields use the supported scalars, lists, or nested
  DTOs. DTO fields map by **declaration order** (positional records → constructor-parameter order).
- The typed proxy supports synchronous, `Task<T>`, and `ValueTask<T>` return shapes.
- **Over IPC:** the in-process `RegisterRpcServiceAsync`/`RpcService<T>` surface is the model; a remote
  facade forwards `InstallRpcAsync` + an invoke call (marshaling args/result) over the existing control
  service — mechanically identical to the GameServer event-kernel plumbing.

### Tests

[`RpcKernelRuntimeTests`](../../../tests/SafeIR.Tests/Plugins/Rpc/RpcKernelRuntimeTests.cs) (loop →
host binding per element → `List<Record>` in one roundtrip; JSON round-trip; capability deny;
arg-count guard), [`RpcKernelGenerationTests`](../../../tests/SafeIR.Tests/Plugins/Rpc/RpcKernelGenerationTests.cs)
(plain-C# `[KernelRpcService]` → generated IR → install → invoke), and
[`KernelRpcServiceProxyTests`](../../../tests/SafeIR.Tests/Plugins/Rpc/KernelRpcServiceProxyTests.cs)
(the typed proxy + `RegisterRpcServiceAsync`/`RpcService` + DTO/list marshaller round-trips), plus the
record-type foundation in [`SafeRecordCollectionTests`](../../../tests/SafeIR.Tests/Collections/SafeRecordCollectionTests.cs).
