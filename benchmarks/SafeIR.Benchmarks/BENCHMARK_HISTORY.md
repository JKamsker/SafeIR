# SafeIR Benchmark History

This file is the performance ledger for SafeIR interpreter/compiler optimization work.
Each optimization commit should append the benchmark command and the before/after
numbers it used.

All results below are local stopwatch probes on this machine, run in Release mode.
Ratios are relative to handwritten C# measured in the same run. These probes are
intended for regression hunting and directionally comparing implementation steps;
they are not BenchmarkDotNet statistical reports.

## Commands

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SafeIR.Benchmarks -p:UseSharedCompilation=false -- --probe-compiled
dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SafeIR.Benchmarks -p:UseSharedCompilation=false -- --probe-bindings
dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SafeIR.Benchmarks -p:UseSharedCompilation=false -- --probe-matrix
```

## History

| Step | Commit | Probe | Key result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I32 interpreted loop fast path | `44bc06f` | `--probe-compiled` | Interpreted scalar loop dropped to about 3.3x to 3.5x handwritten in subsequent scalar probes. |
| I32 compiled raw loop path | `024f1ca` | `--probe-compiled` | Scalar compiled loop reached 62.2 ms vs 47.9 ms handwritten, or 1.3x. |
| Binding crossing optimization | `216eec6` | `--probe-bindings` | `math.sqrt` crossing improved from compiled 542.1 ms / 68.8x to 196.7 ms / 25.1x; interpreted improved from 677.7 ms / 86.0x to 514.7 ms / 65.6x. |
| Performance matrix and string length direct path | `31fa6fe` | `--probe-matrix` | Added a matrix for worse cases. `string.length` compiled improved from about 426 ms to 59-62 ms for 1M calls; interpreted improved from about 411 ms to 299-305 ms. |
| Local function call in I32 loop fast path | this commit | `--probe-matrix` | `local function call` improved from compiled 73.1 ms / 352.2x and interpreted 266.6 ms / 1284.3x to compiled 20.6 ms / 97.7x and interpreted 23.2 ms / 109.8x. |

## Current Gaps

The broad performance target is not met yet. The matrix still exposes several
bad cases, especially collection intrinsics, map access, `math.sqrt` binding
crossing, and the absolute handwritten baseline for tiny operations where the
handwritten timing is sub-millisecond.
